# **Intro to LLMs**

Welcome to the **Intro to Large Language Models (LLMs)** repository! This repository provides practical and beginner-friendly guides to working with popular LLM frameworks and tasks. You'll find examples of using GPT models, Hugging Face Transformers, and more.

## **1. GPT Models**
Explore how to use GPT models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) for various text generation tasks:
- Text generation
- Summarization
- Chat-based applications

Example:  
Check out the [GPT Models](gpt_models/) directory for Python scripts demonstrating how to use OpenAI's GPT API for text generation.

---

## **2. Hugging Face Transformers**
Learn to use Hugging Face's powerful `transformers` library to experiment with various pre-trained LLMs. This section includes:
- Loading pre-trained models.
- Tokenization and inference.
- Fine-tuning models on custom datasets.

Example:  
See the [Hugging Face Transformers](huggingfacetransformers/) directory for Jupyter notebooks and scripts.

---

## **3. Question and Answers with BERT**
Implement a question-answering system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This includes:
- Loading a pre-trained BERT QA model.
- Providing context and answering questions.
- Fine-tuning BERT for your own datasets.

Example:  
Visit the [Question and Answers with BERT](question_and_answers_with_bert/) directory for hands-on examples.

---

## **4. Text Classification with XLNet**
Perform text classification tasks using XLNet, a transformer model that improves upon BERT with bidirectional autoregressive pretraining. This includes:
- Sentiment analysis.
- Topic classification.
- Training on custom datasets.

Example:  
Refer to the [Text Classification with XLNet](text_classification_with_xlnet/) directory for scripts and notebooks.

## **Setup and Installation**
To run the examples, youâ€™ll need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sasivirat/LLMs_Fundamentals.git
   cd intro-to-llms
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the examples:
   Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., `gpt_models`) and execute the scripts.
